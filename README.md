# PDGP: Pretty Damn Good Privacy #
Welcome to the PDGP project â€“ Pretty Damn Good Privacy, an educational initiative aimed at showcasing a simplified secure messaging system inspired by the principles of PGP (Pretty Good Privacy). This project provides a hands-on exploration of key cryptographic concepts such as key generation, digital signatures, and message encryption. Our mission is not only to educate but also to raise awareness about the importance of open-source privacy solutions. Please bear in mind that PDGP is intended solely for educational purposes and is not suitable for real-world secure communication. For any practical implementation, thorough testing and expert consultation are essential.

 ## Open Source and Privacy
In a digital world where privacy concerns are growing, open-source projects play a significant role in empowering individuals with tools to protect their sensitive data. Open-source software is transparent and open to scrutiny, which helps identify vulnerabilities and maintain a strong level of trust. By contributing to and supporting open-source projects like PDGP, you contribute to the development of robust privacy solutions that are accessible to all.

# Features
Key Pair Generation: Explore RSA key generation and manage private and public keys.
Digital Signatures: Gain insights into signing messages using private keys for authenticity and integrity verification.
Message Encryption: Discover how messages can be encrypted using symmetric algorithms (e.g., AES) and symmetric keys.
Message Decryption: Understand the process of decrypting messages using private keys and the recovered symmetric key.
How to Contribute
We invite you to contribute to the evolution of the PDGP project by committing changes and submitting pull requests. Whether you're experienced in cryptography or a newcomer, your insights are valuable. Feel free to propose enhancements, bug fixes, or entirely new features. By collaborating, we can collectively improve and refine this educational endeavor.

# Getting Started
Generate Key Pair (generate_keys.py): Execute this script to generate a private key for decryption and a public key for encryption. Customize key size and parameters as needed.

Sign and Verify Messages (sign_verify.py): Utilize the provided code to sign messages using the private key and verify the authenticity of signed messages using the public key.

Encrypt and Decrypt Messages (encrypt_decrypt.py): Implement the encryption and decryption logic for secure messaging. Encrypt messages using recipients' public keys and symmetric keys, and decrypt messages using the private key.

 ### Disclaimer ###
Please be aware that while this project aims to educate and provide insights into cryptographic concepts, it should not be used for actual secure communication. True secure systems require thorough expertise, testing, and collaboration with security experts.
